# Forecast

This is an open-ended problem designed to give you a chance to show off your development skills.

## What

Imagine it's Thursday evening and you're trying to decide which of your **three** favorite parks or wilderness areas to visit this weekend. 

Create an API to help you decide where to go by comparing their **precipitation forecasts** over a 3 day period.

## Problem statement
OpenWeatherMap provides forecasts by "city." We'll use the forecast for the closest city to each park as a proxy. Write an API that exposes an endpoint to rank precipitation among 3 cities. 

Documentation for the API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 

You can also use the [search engine](https://openweathermap.org/find?q=) or [weather map](https://openweathermap.org/weathermap?basemap=map&cities=true) to explore data for different locations. 


## Logistics
- Python or Node.js are preferred, but you may choose any programming language, framework, or technology to complete this task.
- Your solution should be submitted as a pull request to this repository.
- You should include instructions for building and running your API.
- Please spend no more than an hour and a half, as we want to be respectful of your time. You'll have time to talk through your solution (as well as any aspects you may have wanted to get to but didn't) during the technical interview. Since that's not a lot of time, remember to keep it simple! (There are no "gotchas" in this challenge. Take everything at face value. There's room for interpretation, just keep track of your assumptions.)
- If you have any questions or need any clarification, please reach out.
